// Predict and explain first...

// This code should log out the houseNumber from the address object
// but it isn't working...
// Fix anything that isn't working

const address = {
  houseNumber: 42,
  street: "Imaginary Road",
  city: "Manchester",
  country: "England",
  postcode: "XYZ 123",
};

console.log(`My house number is ${address["houseNumber"]}`); 
// Predict: reference error will be returned.
// Explain: to access the houseNumber property either dot or bracket notation is needed.
// Solution: address.houseNumber or address["houseNumber"]
